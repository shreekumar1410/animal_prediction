## Overview

This project demonstrates how to train a machine learning model to predict animal categories based on certain attributes. The prediction is made by feeding labeled data to a model, which then generalizes patterns to classify new animals.

The dataset includes features like habitat, leg count, and whether the animal is a carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore.

## Features

- Train a classification model using supervised learning.
- Pre-process input data and apply feature selection.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy.
- Make predictions on new animal data.
  
## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Scikit-learn
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib (for data visualization)
  
## Installation

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shreekumar1410/animal_prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd animal_prediction
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. To run the prediction model, first ensure the dataset is available and pre-processed.
   
2. You can train the model using the provided dataset:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. After the model is trained, you can make predictions on new data:

   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

4. Results will be displayed in the terminal, showing the predicted category for the input data.

## Model Training

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The data goes through pre-processing steps such as cleaning, normalization, and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Model Training**: The model is trained using a classification algorithm, such as Decision Trees or Random Forest.

3. **Evaluation**: After training, the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to determine its performance.

4. **Tuning**: Hyperparameters are tuned to improve the modelâ€™s accuracy.
